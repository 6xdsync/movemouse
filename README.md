# Getting Started
Move Mouse may be open source, but you do not need to be a developer, or compile source code to use it.

1. Vist the [Releases](https://github.com/sw3103/movemouse/releases/) page and locate the latest version.
2. Under the Assets section you will see three available downloads. Download the "move-mouse-x.x.x.zip" file, which contains a single "Move Mouse.exe" file.
3. Before you extract the ZIP file, you may wish to [Unblock](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-windows-blocked-access-file) it to prevent the annoying security warnings.
4. Extract the ZIP file to your chosen location and run "Move Mouse.exe".

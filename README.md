# User Guide
## Getting Started
By default, Move Mouse is configured to move your mouse cursor every 30 seconds.

You can start this by clicking Move Mouse, at which point you will see the outer ring turn green, and the 30 second countdown begins.

Once the countdown is complete, Move Mouse will perform the specified Actions (in this case, moving the mouse cursor).

Move Mouse will continue to repeat these Actions, unless you stop them by clicking once again.

You can also start/stop Move Mouse by double-clicking the system tray icon.

## Hover Buttons
You will quickly notice that Move Mouse will present you with some options when you hover your mouse cursor.
